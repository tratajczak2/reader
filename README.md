# reader is not working yet but I am running out of time, subsequent execution fails in HSQLDB because database already exists. There is some problem with db name.
The concurrent code has not been tested. I really think 2 hours is not enough to make the testing meaningfull.

To run: from root directory of the project: java -cp . build/classes reader.LogReader <path to the log file, no file name>
